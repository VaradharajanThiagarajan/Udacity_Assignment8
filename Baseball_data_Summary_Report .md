### Summary :
Objective is to investigate the given Baseball dataset and report the factors that influences the player's average score. Dataset has few factor variables like handedness, height,weight,Home run count. Average score is the variable in which we are interested since more the average, better the player . Visualisations will be created using the Tableau to study about the given factor variables and then the final inference will be documented.

### Design :
As part of design process, visualizations were created to  answer below questions <br>                                            1) what is the  percentage distribution of Handedness ? Created a Bar chart showing the % distribution <br>                      2) is there relationship between  Handedness and Average score ? Created a Bar chart to study the relationship<br>                3) Does the player wth higher number of home runs would have higher average score? created a scatter plot between the average score and Number of home runs <br>                                                                                                4) Who hit higher number of home runs - is it right handed players or left handed players? created a Bar graph depicting the handedness and the average number of home runs<br>                                                                             5) Does the weight of the player affect his/her score ? created a line chart between weight and average score <br>                6) Does the height of the player affect his/her score?  created a line chart between height and average score   <br>

Filter options were introduced in the dashboard/Story and for the weight vs average score plot as well for the height vs average score , removed the line chart and modified it to use the bar graph. <br>

Further, I worked on the comments of the udacity reviewer and corrected the Story Captions .Also used a scatter plot with trend line ( rather than the bar chart )for three plots as listed - 1) weight Vs average score, 2) height vs average score, 3) height/weight vs average score. <br> <br>

### Feedback :
1) In the given Tableau Story, apart from  using the seperate visualizations for height and weight relationship with the average score introduce a visualisation based on the (Height/weight) Ratio  with the average score.<br>                                 2) Also introduce the filter options in Dashboard and Story based on the Handedness.   <br>                                      3) For the weight vs average score and height vs average score plot, use  the bar graph rather than the line chart          


### Inference :
Based on the visualisations, we could infer below points. <br>                                                                    1) Left Handed players seem to have better average score compared to right handed players.<br>                                    2) Left handed players seem to score more home runs on average compared to right handed players and both handed players. <br>    3) Taller players seem to have less average score.   Similarly as weight increases score seems to decline                                                                                                                                           
###### It would have been better if there had been more records for left handed players and Both handed players. The Given dataset had large number of Right handed player records compared to left handed player and both handed player.
